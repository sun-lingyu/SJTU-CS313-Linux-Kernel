## SJTU-CS313 spring2021  

- [ ] lab1-kernel module
- [ ] lab2-process management
- [x] lab3-memory management
- [x] lab4-file system
- [x] final project: hacking syscall

## Some Explanation

> Lab1 is a warmup.  
> Similar job has been done when learning the book *Operating System Concept*.  
> So lab1 is not written.

> Lab2 is relatively easy.  
> I've lost my code after a careless deletion of my cloud resource.   
> I don't think it worthy to write it again.

> Other lab codes are inside the corresponding folders.  
> Further explanation can be found in them respectively.  

## Other
Lab3 is implemented on Linux  5.12.9  
Lab4 and final project are inplemented on linux 5.5.11  
This strange condition is because of the careless deletion of cloud resource.  
(Luckily, the code for lab3 survives.
